# Medi-Clock-Web-App
This is the Medi Clock Webb app Developed by 2022/23 HICT Students in Group 11. 
MediClock is a user-friendly medication reminder web application designed to help users manage their daily medicines accurately and on time. The system allows users to add, edit, and schedule medications with customizable meal timing, dosage, reminders, and notification types. Its clean interface ensures easy navigation while reducing the risk of missed or incorrect medication intake.

The application is built using React and React Router, with persistent state management to maintain user changes across page navigation until the app is closed. MediClock focuses on reliability, simplicity, and practical usability, making it suitable for personal use as well as future expansion into caregiver or distant-patient support systems.
